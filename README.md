## Spain Real Estate Scrapper
Kotlin based scrapper that scraps real estate properties and export it to Firebase Cloud Firestore.

## Motivation
Real estate experiences lacks many features for home hunting, making it really difficult to navigate, apply filters etc. The scrap is used for personal usage only.
